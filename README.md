🤟 Sign Language Detection using CNN

Welcome to Sign Language Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)!
This project is built to help bridge the communication gap between the hearing and speech-impaired community and the rest of the world 🌍.

Using deep learning, we can recognize hand gestures representing different alphabets and translate them into meaningful outputs.

🚀 Features

📷 Detects hand gestures representing sign language alphabets.

🧠 Powered by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for high accuracy.

🎯 Easy-to-use interface for real-time or image-based prediction.

📊 Well-structured dataset preprocessing and training pipeline.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 🐍

TensorFlow / Keras (for CNN model)

NumPy, Pandas (data handling)

OpenCV (image processing)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (visualizations)
